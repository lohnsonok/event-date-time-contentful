# Contentful Local Date UI Extension

This is a UI extension for Contentful which sets dates to your local timezone without having to worry about time changes.*

## Status

This is currently a proof of concept. It is working but could use more testing and some usability adjustments.

\* Unless youâ€™re working with dates in the far future or your country decides to change their time zone on short notice.

Slug Generator

![slug-widget](http://contentful.github.io/extensions/assets/slug-widget.png)

This extension enables to generate a slug using the title of the entry.
It also checks whether or not any duplicates across the other entries of the
same content type exist to warn users before publishing.

**Note**: In order to prevent publication whenever another entry has the same
value for the field, it is advised to use the "Uniqueness" validation constraint.
It can be combined with this extension.
